- i am not handling functions that end in amb but are not amb
	eg:
	function make_into_lamb() {
	}
	will parse as function make_into_lamb((), (n) => {{
	})};
- actually this is really cool as it kinda separates logical purity (ok not functional purity but
		the logical purity with reducing the search space) is really neatly separated
	into fail/assert and amb. very cool
